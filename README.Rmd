# Prophyl

Prophyl is a bioinformatics pipeline for creating bacterial phylogenetic trees with dates and predicting ancestral states for a number of character variables.

The pipeline is written in two programming languages, R and Nextflow:
* R is used to facilitate preparing input data and working with the results.
The tool contains a number of R functions which may be loaded as any other R package.
* Nextflow is used to run the pipeline itself.
