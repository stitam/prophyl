\usage{
create_link(from, type, fsep = "/")
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{charcater; path to a directory which contains genome sequences.}

\item{type}{character; the type of genomes sequences stored in the
\code{from} directory. Can be either \code{"raw_reads"},
or \code{"assembled_genomes"}.}

\item{fsep}{character; the path separator to use.}
}
\description{
This function creates a directory structure within the working directory for
storing genome sequences in a standardized form, and then creates symbolic
links which point to genome sequences elsewhere in the file system.
}
\details{
The analysis pipeline requires that genome sequences are organised
in a standardized directory structure inside the working directory. This
structure is designed to provide maximum flexibility. While it is possible to
organize the genome sequences themselves, it is more efficient to create
symbolic links instead which point to these files. This function sets up the
directory structure inside the working directory and fills it up with
symbolic links.
