\title{Mask a distance matrix}
\usage{
mask_matrix(df, id_var, focus_by = NULL, focus_on = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame; a data frame containing sample metadata}

\item{id_var}{character; a variable of the df we want to use as row and
column names. Must be unique for each row of the data frame.}

\item{focus_by}{character; a variable of the df we want to focus on}

\item{focus_on}{character; one or more values of focus_by we want to focus on}
}
\value{
a matrix
}
\description{
This helper function is used in distance calculations where we do want to
include all tips of a phylogenetic tree and perform pairwise comparisons, 
but we also want to define a focus group and exclude comparisons where
neither of the two samples belong to the focus group. This function creates
a masking matrix that can be used to replace these comparisons with NAs.

\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  assembly = LETTERS[1:5],
  continent = c("europe", "europe", "asia", "europe", "asia"),
  country = c("hungary", "croatia", "china", "serbia", "thailand")
)
# focus on European samples
mask_matrix(
  df,
  id_var = "assembly",
  focus_by = "continent",
  focus_on = "europe"
)
# focus on samples from Croatia or Thailand
mask_matrix(
  df,
  id_var = "assembly",
  focus_by = "country",
  focus_on = c("croatia", "thailand")
)
