\title{Variable identity matrix}
\usage{
varid_matrix(df, id_var, var = "country", focus_on = NULL, focus_by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame; a data frame containing sample metadata}

\item{id_var}{character; a variable of the df we want to use as row and
column names. Must be unique for each row of the data frame.}

\item{var}{character; a variable of the df to assess}

\item{focus_on}{character; one or more values of focus_by to focus on}

\item{focus_by}{character; a variable of the df to focus on}
}
\value{
a matrix
}
\description{
This function calculates a matrix which tells whether a selected variable is 
the same for pairs of samples, e.g. whether pairs fo samples were collected
in the same country. This matrix is one of the "distance" matrices used in
risk calculations.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  assembly = LETTERS[1:5],
  continent = c("europe", "europe", "asia", "europe", "asia"),
  country = c("hungary", "hungary", "china", "serbia", "china"),
  city = c("budapest", "szeged", "beijing", "belgrade", "beijing")
)
# which samples come from the same country
varid_matrix(df, id_var = "assembly", var = "country")
# same but focus on European samples
varid_matrix(
  df, 
  id_var = "assembly", 
  var = "country", 
  focus_by = "continent", 
  focus_on = "europe"
 )
# which samples have the same mlst
varid_matrix(df, id_var = "assembly", var = "city")
